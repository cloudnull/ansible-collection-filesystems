# * drives           -- An array of devices.
# * logical_volumes  -- A hash of logical volumes to be created under a given VG, with each volume
#                       key additional configuration can be defined. If no additional configuration
#                       is needed the key can be used with an empty hash or null.
#
#   Logical volumes can be forcefully resized by setting the `resizefs` option to **true**.
#   Logical volumes can not shrink, the role forcefully prohibits this to protect data.

# The pe_config dictionary allows operators to further control how physical volumes are represented.
# The default will allow the module to dynamically resize the physical volume, and sets a known good
# size. Use `pv_options` to further define advanced configuration as needed.
